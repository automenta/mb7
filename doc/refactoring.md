# Refactoring Suggestions for `core` Directory

This document outlines suggested refactoring steps for the `core` directory, focusing on using modern JavaScript features for more compact, consolidated, fluent, and elegant code.

## db.js

*   Use `const` for variables that don't need to be reassigned (e.g., `generatePrivateKey`).
*   Use arrow functions for concise function definitions (e.g., `generatePrivateKey`).
*   Consider using destructuring for extracting values from objects (e.g., in `get` and `save` methods).
*   Use async/await for better readability when dealing with promises.

## error-handler.js

*   No specific refactoring suggestions at this time.

## match.js

*   Use arrow functions for concise function definitions (e.g., `checkTime`).

## net.js

*   Use `const` for variables that don't need to be reassigned.
*   Use async/await for better readability when dealing with promises.

## ontology.js

*   No specific refactoring suggestions at this time.

## tag-utils.js

*   Use `const` for variables that don't need to be reassigned.
*   Use arrow functions for concise function definitions (e.g., `extractTagValue`).
