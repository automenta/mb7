    Organize, prioritize, and grow thoughts into actionable results with real-time communication, matching, and analysis.

    ## Features

    ### Objects
    - **Shared Objects:** Create, prioritize, and manage data collaboratively as `NObject`s.
    - **Thought Evolution:** `NObject`s describe thoughts and ideas.
    - **Privacy by Default:** All `NObject`s are private unless explicitly shared.

    ### Search and Match
    - **Persistent Queries:** `NObject`s can act as ongoing search interests. (Stubbed)
    - **Semantic Matching:** `NObject`s capture meaning and intent. (Stubbed)
    - **Tags:** Descriptive `NObject` typed `Tags` (suggested by schemas).
    - **Notifications:** The app receives matches to shared `NObject`s as replies. (Stubbed)

    ### P2P Network
    - **Decentralized:**
    - Nostr for public p2p communication
    - WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer communication.
    - **Synchronized:**
    - `yjs` CRDT enables incremental updates and offline editing.
    - WebRTC allows direct peer-to-peer communication. (Yjs/WebRTC setup)
    - **Secure:**
    - End-to-end encryption protects private data. (Stubbed)
    - Crypto-signing ensures `NObject` integrity and provenance. (Nostr signing stubbed)
